# Optimal Planning is not feasible


## Number of variables too big (index 12 million variables by time and location)


## Complexity of interior point methods is greater than convex


### Even worse, the problem is non-convex


### Even worse, we don&rsquo;t even know what the problem is exactly

1.  Can&rsquo;t decide on the plan/objective function (it&rsquo;s a political decision)

1.  Planner&rsquo;s preferences / Democracy / Authoritarianism


## Interestingly &ldquo;Computing optimal prices has the same complexity as directly computing the optimal plan&rdquo;


### This also breaks &ldquo;marker-are-always-the-optimal-mechanism&rdquo; arguments :)

-   Stiglitz: &ldquo;If neo-classicals were right about how capitalism works, Kantorovich-style
socialism would have been perfectly viable&rdquo;
-   &ldquo;Markets with non-convexities are apt to see things like monopolies, or at least monopolistic competition (&#x2026;)&rdquo;


## Trotsky

-   &ldquo;The innumerable living participants in the economy (&#x2026;) must serve notice of
their needs and of their relative strength, not only through the statistical determinations
of plan commissions, but by the direct pressure of suppluy and demand. The plan
is checked and, to a considerable degree, realized by the market&rdquo;


## Markets are a good feedback mechanism


# Alien view of bug green areas (orgs) connected by a few red threads (markets)


# Conditions for price equilibrium are non-realistic


# Demand vs Effective Demand


## Not everyone&rsquo;s voice weighs the same


## Give people more demand power = more efficient feedback system


## Pathology comes not intrinsically from market exchange, but from market exchange + gross inequality
