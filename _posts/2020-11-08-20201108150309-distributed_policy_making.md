# Is there a way to organize extremely efficient grassroots initiatives?


## Using data / simulations / cellular-automata to come-up with strategies


### Optimal action recommendation

Too much effort lowers the participation level; too little effort lowers the
impact. What is the optimal balance between small action vs big impact?

-   Critical mass / Snowball effect
-   How many people does a movement require to be effective?
-   Simple behavioural changes can create potentially very large-scale effects
(cellular automata / simulations)
-   &ldquo;If we all did X we could accomplish Y in Z time&rdquo;


### Smart & distributed protests/movements/unions

-   Extremely organized and efficient
-   Decentralization & fault-tolerance
-   Federated networks of movement members
