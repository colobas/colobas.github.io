This is my website, built with Jekyll and Svelte.
I used [this blogpost](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618184658/https://davidtang.io/2020-01-25-adding-svelte-3-to-a-jekyll-site/)
as a starting point, to have Svelte components in my Jekyll website.

# TODO

- fix CSS for posts
- fix exporting from org articles
