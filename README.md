This is my website, built with Jekyll and Svelte.

It has some logic to use Svelte components in Jekyll, which I took from 
[this blogpost](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618184658/https://davidtang.io/2020-01-25-adding-svelte-3-to-a-jekyll-site/),
although at the moment I'm only using it for the "$ Hello friend" message at
the home page.

The general layout is based on [klise](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) and
the style for the posts is based on [my fork of tufte-pandoc-jekyll](https://github.com/colobas/tufte-pandoc-jekyll)


# TODO
